This C++ program is a simple bookshop management system. It allows users to perform various operations such as inserting new books, searching for books by ID or name, updating book details, deleting books, and showing all books in the inventory.Here's a brief description of each function:

1. Heading(): This function displays a welcome message and a separator.

2. Insert(): This function allows the user to insert a new book into the system. It prompts the user to enter details such as book ID, name, author name, publisher name, and price. It then adds the book to the linked list data structure and also appends the details to a file named `bookshop_file.txt`.

3. Search(): This function allows the user to search for a book either by ID or by name. It prompts the user to enter either the book ID or the book name, then searches through the linked list to find a match. If found, it displays the details of the book.

4. Update(): This function allows the user to update the details of an existing book. It prompts the user to enter the book ID of the book to be updated, then allows them to modify the book's name, author name, publisher name, and price.

5. Delete(): This function allows the user to delete a book from the inventory. It prompts the user to enter the book ID of the book to be deleted, then removes it from the linked list.

6. Show(): This function displays all the books in the inventory. It traverses the linked list and prints the details of each book.

7. main(): This is the main function where the program execution starts. It displays a menu of options for the user to choose from and calls the corresponding function based on the user's choice.

Overall, this program provides a basic interface for managing a bookshop inventory. It uses a linked list to store book details and file I/O for persisting the data. However, there are some improvements that can be made, such as error handling and input validation in certain functions.
